# gws — Google Workspace CLI Plugin for Claude Code

A Claude Code plugin that gives Claude full read/write access to Google Workspace services via the [`gws` CLI](https://github.com/googleworkspace/cli). 92 skills covering Gmail, Drive, Calendar, Sheets, Docs, Chat, Slides, Forms, Tasks, Keep, Meet, Classroom, and more.

## Why this plugin?

### Go beyond Claude's built-in Google Drive integration

Claude's native Google Workspace connectors are read-only for Drive/Docs, can't access email attachments, can't edit Sheets/Slides, and can only create Gmail drafts (not send). This plugin gives Claude full CRUD access to all Workspace services.

| Capability | Claude Native | With gws plugin |
|---|---|---|
| Read Google Docs | Yes | Yes |
| Edit Google Docs | No | Yes |
| Read/Write Sheets | No | Yes |
| Gmail attachments | No | Yes |
| Send emails | Drafts only | Full send |
| Google Chat | No | Yes |
| Meet, Forms, Tasks, Keep, Classroom | No | Yes |

### Migrating from OpenClaw to Claude Cowork + Dispatch

OpenClaw users moving to Claude's safer, sandboxed Cowork + Dispatch environment lose access to OpenClaw's 50+ service integrations and 13,000+ community skills. This plugin restores advanced Google Workspace automation within Claude's ecosystem — 92 pre-built skills including personas (Executive Assistant, IT Admin, etc.) and step-by-step recipes (post-mortem setup, expense tracking, team announcements). You get OpenClaw-like Google Workspace connectors with Cowork's security model.
